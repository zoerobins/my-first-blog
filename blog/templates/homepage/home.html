        <h3>
        <p>I'm Zoe and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham.
        I have just completed my Year in Industry within a Cyber SOC and I'll be using this site to share all things CS related!</p>
        <p>As I start my final year at university, I am looking for a graduate role in Cyber Security or Incident Response.</p>
        <p>I love travelling, taking photos, and I always have a list on the go. I'm part of the Touch Rugby club here at UoB and also played for a local team whilst on my placement year, as well as being a Student Ambassador for my course.</p>
        <p>Hopefully this site will give you an insight into who I am, and I intend to display more projects on here as I complete them!</p>
        </h3>
