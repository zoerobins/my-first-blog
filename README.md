# Blog website

## Description
This personal blog website is a place for me to share blog posts about my university course and host projects that I have worked on recently. 
The site has a home page, a blog page, and project pages, and also includes a login page. 
The login page allows users to login to the site with a username and password, and once logged in users are able to create new blog posts (which can be saved as drafts), and add comments to existing posts.

## Technologies used
The site is mainly programmed in Python and HTML, and also uses some CSS, Django and Bootstrap.  
Django is a web framework used alongside Python and this was used to create the main pages for the site.  
Bootstrap was used to create the navigation bar which links to each page of the site.
